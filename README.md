# Mysterious Powerking Conspiracy

_A tale of the (second) complete nibble rewrite._

It's that time of the year again - time for a complete nibble rewrite.

## Development

Simply run `npm i -g typescript tslint webpack webpack-dev-server` to get all of your development tool up and running, `yarn` to install the dependencies of the project (this might take a second or two), and then `yarn start` to fire up the wonderful dev server.

PS: You should also install [Redux DevTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotedev/) (you can
probably find one for chrome/vivaldi/etc. as well), and [React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/?src=search). These make your life a whole lot easier when debugging. I've also set up logging of all redux actions in the browser console, so the first one isn't necessary (though I still advice getting it).

## Screenshots

Will be added soon(tm).
